# ðŸ“± Parity Signer Landing Page

This repository stores the landing page for the Parity Signer app. Because Github Pages only allow to have 1 static site per repository, and the original repository already has a Wiki living in it.

- Signer App repo: github.com/paritytech/parity-signer
- Github Pages deployment: https://paritytech.github.io/signer-website/
- Live URL (still old): http://parity.io/signer
